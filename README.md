Introduction

SquarePeg is a C# web application that is is built to be a free, open sourced task management board. It was started as a side project to demonstrate a modular and extremely decoupled web application. It is built on top of ServiceStack instead of using the built in .net WebAPI framework.

Note: this open source project is no longer in use.
